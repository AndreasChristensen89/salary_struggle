As you may be aware, Django released v4 yesterday.
However, we recommend that you do NOT use Django 4 for the walkthroughs or projects, for 2 important reasons:
Django 3.2 is the LTS (Long Term Support) version, which means it is the longest supported version of Django available. Django 4.2 will not be LTS until at least April 2023
The version of AllAuth that we use in our videos is incompatible with django 4.
Please stick to Django 3.2 to avoid conflicts and confusion until further notice.
