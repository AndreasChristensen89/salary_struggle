            <h3 class="h3">SETTING</h3>
                <p>
                The game takes place in a fictional city, lightly inspired by Tokyo, where you play as an unfortunate 
                soul who has piles of debt. The only way forward is to get a job as a self taught 
                programmer within 30 days. This is no easy task, and you need more than coding skills to make it.
